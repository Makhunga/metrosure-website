**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Strategic Recommendation

## Executive Summary

Metrosure operates two fundamentally distinct business lines that require separate digital presences:

1. **Metrosure Insurance Solutions** – A Financial Services Provider (FSP) offering regulated insurance products to individuals and small businesses
2. **Metro Risk Consulting** – A consulting practice providing risk management advisory services to corporate clients

This document outlines the strategic imperative for maintaining clear separation between these two business activities, with particular emphasis on regulatory compliance, brand clarity, and operational effectiveness.

## The Case for Clear Separation

> **⚠️ STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE**
> Clear separation between Metrosure's regulated insurance activities and unregulated consulting services is not optional—it is a fundamental business requirement that protects the organisation's licence to operate.

### Why Separation is Essential

The following four pillars establish why complete separation of Metrosure's business activities is non-negotiable:

### 1. Regulatory Clarity

FSP-regulated activities **must** be clearly distinguished from unregulated consulting services. The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) requires that consumers can immediately identify when they are engaging with a regulated financial services provider versus an unregulated advisory service.

**Key requirement:** A consumer visiting the website must never be confused about whether they are purchasing a regulated insurance product or engaging consulting services.

### 2. Brand Identity

Each business serves fundamentally different audiences with entirely different needs:

| Aspect | Insurance (Metrosure) | Consulting (Metro Risk) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Audience** | Individuals, families, SMEs | Corporate risk managers, executives |
| **Mindset** | Personal protection | Strategic investment |
| **Relationship** | Transactional | Partnership |
| **Decision-maker** | Individual/family | Committee/board |
| **Communication style** | Simple, reassuring | Technical, analytical |

Attempting to serve both audiences from a single website creates cognitive dissonance and dilutes both value propositions.

### 3. Operational Independence

The two business lines operate with completely different commercial dynamics:

| Metric | Insurance | Consulting |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Sales cycle** | Days to weeks | Months to years |
| **Average transaction** | R500 – R5,000/month | R50,000 – R500,000+ per engagement |
| **Decision process** | Individual choice | Procurement/tender |
| **Onboarding** | Automated | Custom scoping |
| **Service delivery** | Standardised products | Bespoke solutions |

These differences demand separate marketing strategies, sales processes, and client journeys.

### 4. Risk Mitigation

> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING**
> Mixing regulated and unregulated content on a single website creates significant risk to Metrosure's FSP licence and business continuity.

**Risks of inadequate separation:**
- FSCA audit findings and enforcement action
- Potential suspension or revocation of FSP licence
- Reputational damage in both market segments
- Consumer complaints and regulatory investigations
- Confusion among staff about compliance obligations

## 1. Business Context

### 1.1 The Business Case for Separation

The stark contrast between Metrosure's two business lines makes the case for separation self-evident:

#### Comparison: Insurance vs Consulting

| Factor | Metrosure Insurance | Metro Risk Consulting |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Decision timeline** | Days | Months |
| **Transaction size** | R500/month typical | R500,000+ per engagement |
| **Regulatory burden** | Heavy (FSP-regulated) | Minimal (professional services) |
| **Trust signals required** | FSP number, FSCA compliance, product disclosures | Case studies, credentials, industry expertise |
| **Marketing approach** | B2C, emotional, protective | B2B, rational, strategic |
| **Website purpose** | Quote, compare, purchase | Educate, qualify, engage |
| **Success metric** | Conversion rate | Lead quality |

> **💡 STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE**
> These are not variations of the same business—they are fundamentally different enterprises that happen to share expertise in risk. Treating them as one dilutes both.

### 1.2 Regulatory Landscape

Metrosure Insurance Solutions operates as a licensed Financial Services Provider under the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services (FAIS) Act. This regulatory status brings significant obligations—and significant risks if not properly managed.

#### FSCA Compliance Requirements

The FSCA requires that FSPs:
- Clearly identify themselves as regulated entities in all client communications
- Provide mandated disclosures before product recommendations
- Maintain clear records of advice and transactions
- Ensure marketing materials comply with Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) outcomes

#### The Compliance Risk of Mixed Content

> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING**
> Mixing FSP-regulated insurance content with unregulated consulting content on a single website creates audit risk and regulatory exposure.

**Specific risks include:**

1. **Audit complexity** – FSCA auditors may struggle to distinguish which content relates to regulated activities, leading to extended audits and potential findings

2. **Disclosure confusion** – Insurance products require specific disclosures that are inappropriate for consulting services; mixed content makes correct disclosure placement difficult

3. **Advice boundary ambiguity** – When does risk consulting become financial advice? A combined website makes this boundary dangerously unclear

4. **TCF compliance** – Treating Customers Fairly outcomes must demonstrably apply to insurance clients; consulting clients have different (unregulated) expectations

#### FSCA Enforcement Reality

The FSCA has demonstrated willingness to take enforcement action against FSPs that fail to maintain proper compliance standards:

- **Administrative penalties** – Fines for compliance failures
- **Licence conditions** – Additional requirements imposed on non-compliant FSPs
- **Licence suspension** – Temporary inability to conduct regulated business
- **Licence revocation** – Permanent loss of FSP status

> **⚠️ STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE**
> The FSP licence is the foundation of Metrosure's insurance business. Separation is not about preference—it's about protecting the licence that enables the business to operate.

## 2. Recommended Website Architecture

### 2.1 Separate Domains

| Business | Domain | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Metrosure Insurance | metrosure.co.za | Consumer insurance products and services |
| Metro Risk Consulting | metrorisk.co.za | Corporate risk consulting services |

### 2.2 No Cross-Contamination

The websites should operate as independent entities:

- **No shared navigation** – Users should not be able to accidentally navigate from one business to another
- **Distinct visual identity** – Different colour palettes, typography, and imagery
- **Separate compliance frameworks** – Each site implements only the disclosures relevant to its regulated status
- **Independent analytics** – Separate tracking to understand distinct customer journeys

### 2.3 Appropriate Cross-Referencing

Where legitimate business reasons exist to reference the sister company:

- Use clear, compliant language: *"Metrosure is part of the Metro group, which also includes Metro Risk Consulting for corporate clients"*
- Place references in footer or "About" sections, not primary navigation
- Ensure any links open in new windows/tabs to maintain clear context
- Never imply that consulting services are FSP-regulated

---

## 3. Implementation Considerations

### 3.1 Immediate Priorities

1. **Audit current content** – Identify any areas where insurance and consulting content are currently mixed
2. **Define content ownership** – Assign clear responsibility for each website's content compliance
3. **Establish review processes** – Ensure new content is reviewed for appropriate placement before publication

### 3.2 Ongoing Governance

- Regular compliance reviews of both websites
- Clear escalation procedures for content that may cross boundaries
- Staff training on the importance and requirements of separation
- Annual strategy review to ensure separation remains appropriate

---

## 4. Conclusion

> **💡 FINAL STRATEGIC IMPERATIVE**
> Clear separation is not optional—it is a business imperative that protects Metrosure's FSP licence, strengthens both brands, and serves each customer segment more effectively.

The case for separation is compelling across every dimension:

- **Regulatory:** Protects the FSP licence and ensures FSCA compliance
- **Commercial:** Enables focused marketing to distinct customer segments
- **Operational:** Allows optimised customer journeys for different sales cycles
- **Reputational:** Builds appropriate trust signals for each audience

This strategy should be implemented as a matter of priority and maintained as a core operating principle for the organisation.
