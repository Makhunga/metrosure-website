## 3. Enhanced FAQ Content

### Life Cover FAQs

**Q: How accurate is this calculator?**
> This calculator provides an indicative estimate based on industry-standard formulas and the information you provide. Actual premiums depend on factors like age, health status, smoking habits, occupation, and insurer underwriting criteria. For a personalised quote, speak to one of our advisers.

**Q: Why do you ask about my dependents?**
> Dependents significantly impact your life cover needs. Each dependent may require ongoing income support, education funding (approximately R250,000 per child through tertiary level), and daily living expenses. The more dependents you have, the higher your coverage should be to maintain their lifestyle.

**Q: What's included in income replacement?**
> Income replacement covers the years of salary your family would need if you passed away. We calculate this by multiplying your annual income by your chosen support period (typically 5-30 years). This ensures your family can maintain their current standard of living, pay bills, and meet ongoing financial commitments.

**Q: How much life cover do most South Africans have?**
> According to ASISA's 2025 Insurance Gap Study, the average South African income earner has only R800,000 in life cover—but needs at least R2.1 million. This leaves an average shortfall of R1.3 million per person. Over 60% of families would face financial hardship if the primary earner passed away unexpectedly.

**Q: Do I need life cover if I have employer group life?**
> Group life benefits from your employer are valuable but often insufficient. They typically provide 2-4 times your annual salary, whereas financial experts recommend 10-15 times. Additionally, group cover ends when you leave your job. A personal policy provides continuous protection regardless of employment status.

**Q: What happens to my debts when I die?**
> Outstanding debts like home loans, personal loans, and credit cards don't disappear when you pass away. Your estate (and potentially your family) may be responsible for settling these obligations. Life cover can clear these debts, preventing your family from losing assets or facing financial stress.

### Funeral Cover FAQs

**Q: How much does an average funeral cost in South Africa?**
> Funeral costs in South Africa range widely depending on your choices. A basic burial starts at R8,000-R15,000, while a traditional funeral with catering for 50 guests can cost R70,000-R84,000. Metropolitan estimates many families spend between R23,500 and R120,000 when including tombstones, flowers, and catering.

**Q: What does funeral cover typically include?**
> Most funeral cover policies provide a lump-sum payout within 24-48 hours of claim submission. This covers funeral parlour fees, coffin or casket, burial plot, hearse, and basic ceremony. Premium plans may include grocery benefits, airtime, and repatriation services. Our plans also include funeral assistance to help with arrangements.

**Q: Can I cover extended family members?**
> Yes, most funeral policies allow you to add a spouse, children, and parents. Each additional member increases your premium by approximately 40% of the base rate. Children typically receive 50% of the main member's cover amount, while parents receive 75%. This ensures your entire family is protected.

**Q: Is there a waiting period for funeral cover?**
> Most funeral policies have a waiting period of 6 months for natural death claims. However, accidental death is typically covered immediately from day one. This waiting period helps prevent fraudulent claims and keeps premiums affordable for all policyholders.

**Q: Why do I need funeral cover if I have savings?**
> While savings can help, they may not be accessible immediately. Banks often freeze accounts upon death notification, and estate processes can take months. Funeral cover pays out within 24-48 hours, ensuring your family can proceed with dignified arrangements without financial stress or delays.

## 6. Educational Messaging Recommendations

### Hero Section Key Points

1. **"Takes 2 minutes"** ✓ (already using)
2. **"No personal details required"** ✓ (already using)
3. **"R1.3m average shortfall"** - NEW: Add statistical urgency
4. **"Expert-backed formulas"** ✓ (already using)

### Suggested New Educational Cards

**Card 1: The R50 Trillion Gap**
> South Africa's life insurance gap has widened to R50.4 trillion—that's 7 times our entire GDP. The average family would receive only 39% of what they need if the primary earner passed away today.

**Card 2: Funeral Costs Rising**
> Funeral costs have increased significantly, with a traditional service now costing R20,000-R40,000 or more. Despite most South Africans having funeral cover, families remain under-insured because they underestimate true costs.

**Card 3: Your Debts Don't Die**
> Outstanding home loans, car finance, and credit cards must still be paid after death. Without adequate life cover, your family may be forced to sell assets or take on debt to settle your estate.
