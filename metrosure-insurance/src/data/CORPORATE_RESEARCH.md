Three components:
1. **Savings Component:** One-third of new contributions, withdrawable once per tax year (minimum R2,000)
2. **Retirement Component:** Two-thirds of new contributions, only accessible at retirement
3. **Vested Component:** Pre-September 2024 savings (old rules apply)

## FAQ Content (Market-Accurate)

### Q: What is the minimum number of employees for group cover?
**A:** Most group schemes work best with **10+ employees** for favourable underwriting. However, smaller groups can often be accommodated through specially negotiated arrangements. Some insurers offer small group solutions for 5+ employees.

### Q: How do group retirement funds differ from individual RAs?
**A:** Group funds benefit from:
- Lower fees (economies of scale)
- Employer contributions (often 5-10% of salary)
- Professional fund management
- Group life and disability cover often included
- Tax-efficient structuring

Individual RAs offer more personal control but typically at higher cost.

### Q: Can we customise the benefits package?
**A:** Absolutely. We design packages tailored to your budget and employee needs. You choose which benefits to include (medical, retirement, risk cover) and at what levels. Packages can be tiered by employee category.

### Q: What happens when an employee leaves?
**A:** Options include:
- Convert group cover to individual policies
- Transfer retirement savings to preservation fund
- Transfer to new employer's scheme
- Cash withdrawal (with tax implications under two-pot rules)

We guide employees through their options at exit.

### Q: How quickly can cover be implemented?
**A:** Standard implementations take **4-6 weeks** from agreement. This includes:
- Scheme setup and FSCA registration (if new fund)
- Employee communication and enrolment
- Payroll integration and testing

Urgent requirements can be expedited.

### Q: Are employer contributions tax-deductible?
**A:** Yes. Employer contributions to:
- Retirement funds: Deductible as business expense

Employee benefits from these contributions are taxed as fringe benefits but then qualify for deductions/credits.
